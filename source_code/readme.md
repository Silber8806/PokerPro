# Poker.py

To run our poker simulation do the following:

```
python poker.py
```

To see our analysis, do the following:

```
cd source_code/analysis
jupyter notebook
```

Then just click Poker Simulation Analysis.  Note the notebook just shows you the
outputs used for charts in the report.

We pre-executed the poker.py outputs and put them in the source_code/analysis/data
folder as it can take 2 hours.  We wanted to save you time as the outputs 
are not large, but the compute time is upwards of 2 hours.
